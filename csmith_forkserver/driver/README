This directory contains a collection of scripts that serve as a
reasonably general-purpose driver for Csmith.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:

To use all features of this driver, the user must provide:

- a script that turns C source code into an executable

- a script that executes (or interprets, emulates, or even sends to an
  attached embedded processor) a compiledprogram, returning a status
  code, a checksum, and perhaps other information

- a script that heuristically disambiguates different ways in which
  the compiler under test can crash

- a script that builds a specified version of the compiler(s) under
  test

All of these are quite straightforward for the case where a native
compiler is being tested, and we provide examples for GCC and LLVM.
Scripts can be more elaborate when an embedded compiler is being
tested.

The driver then builds the latest version of the compiler once per
day. The remaining time is used to test this compiler. When anomalous
results are discovered (e.g. the compiler crashes) a reduced test case
is created and a binary search is used to find the first broken
version of the compiler.

Features of this driver can be selectively disabled. So, for example,
you can disable the compiler version search, the building of new
compilers, and even the running of compiler output -- if all you want
to do is look for crashes in a specific version of a compiler that you
don't have source code or an emulator for.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

You want a fast machine. At first this won't matter but as compiler
quality improves, throughput becomes important. This driver does not
support distribution across machines but it can take advantage of as
many processors are available on a shared memory multiprocessor.

The compiler should be deterministic. It would be a good idea to turn
off address space layout randomization before running this driver.
